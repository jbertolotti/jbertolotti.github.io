          On November 29 I was at the IOP gala dinner, where Prof Roy Sambles awarded me the Moseley medal for early career contributions to experimental Physics. Apart from the honor of being awarded the prize,
          it was a special evening also because Prof. Leggett (Nobel prize laureate in 2003) sent a video message congratulating me for my work. I am not sure I can think of a bigger honor! <br />

          At the beginning of July the <a href="http://www.iop.org/">IoP</a> awarded me with the <a href="http://www.iop.org/about/awards/career/moseley/page_38648.html">Moseley
            Medal</a> for experimental Physics! This is one of the <a href="http://www.iop.org/about/awards/career/page_38645.html">early
            career awards</a> (together with the <a href="http://www.iop.org/about/awards/career/maxwell/page_38656.html">Maxwell medal</a> for theoretical Physics, and the <a href="http://www.iop.org/about/awards/career/paterson/page_38665.html">Paterson
            medal</a> for applied Physics) given by the Institute of Physics
          each year. Past recipients were people of the calibre of Giuseppe
          Occhialini, Jeremy Baumberg, and Jeremy O'Brien, so I feel very
          honored to be in such company! You can find the full citation <a href="http://www.iop.org/about/awards/career/moseley/medallists/page_67615.html">here</a>.<br />
          In November there will be a "gala dinner" where <a href="http://www.iop.org/about/awards/index.html">all
            the prizes</a> (including the prestigious <a href="http://www.iop.org/about/awards/newton/page_38399.html">Newton

          <br />
          On an unrelated note: I was very recently awarded a Leverhulme Research
          grant about "Prime factorization using light"), which means that soon
          I will be able to open a 2-year post-doc position.<br />

          New publication!<br />
          The paper is entitled "<i>Quantum correlation of light scattered by
            disordered media</i>" and study theoretically quantum correlations
          in light scattered by a disordered medium. The main finding of the
          paper is that, even when the input light is very "classical" (e.g.
          thermal), the multiple scattering process is enough for the output
          modes to develop quantum correlations in the form of quantum discord.<br />
          You can find the paper <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-24-5-4662">here</a>

          The paper "<em>Characterization of the angular memory effect of
            scattered light in biological tissues</em>" appeared online a few
          days ago, and present a detailed characterization of the optical
          memory effect in systems where scattering is not isotropic (e.g. most
          biological tissues). Most of the credit goes to San Schott, who did a
          brilliant job (if you consider that at the time he was an
          undergraduate you will understand how impressive his work was).<br />

            </span></span>Starting next September I will begin a new appointment
          as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecturer#Academic_usage">Lecturer</a>
          (the British way of calling an Assistant Professor) at the <a href="http://www.exeter.ac.uk/">University
            of Exeter</a>. In particular I will be part of the <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/research/emag/">Electromagnetic
            and Acoustic Materials group</a> in the <a href="http://emps.exeter.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/">Physics
            and Astronomy Department</a>. I will start my own lab, working on
          light scattering in disordered media and imaging in turbid materials.<br />
          This is a new beginning and, as such, it is very exciting and a bit
          scary. Finger crossed!<br />
          <br />
          I also got an invitation to give an invited talk at the <a href="http://www.opt.utsunomiya-u.ac.jp/iwh13/">IWH
            2013</a> conference in Japan. The conference location is a bit far
          away from the usual destinations (the north of Hokkaido is seriously
          far away from Tokyo), but it will be my first time in the land of the
          raising sun. I did not organize anything yet, so I do not have a lot
          of information myself.<br />

            </span></span>For this spring/summer I am invited at two
          conferences.<br />
          The first one is <a href="http://www.cleoeurope.org/">CLEO Europe
            2013</a>, 12-16 May in Munich (Germany). Originally my talk was a
          submitted one, but they upgraded it to invited. I admit I had no idea
          this was even possible, but I am definitively not complaining. I will
          give my talk, entitled <span style="font-style: italic;">Noninvasive
            Fluorescence Imaging through Strongly Scattering Layers</span>, on
          Sunday<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>12 at 16.30 in the
          session <span style="font-style: italic;">Biophotonics and
            Applications II</span> (room 13b).<br />
          The second one is <a href="http://www.osa.org/en-us/meetings/optics_and_photonics_congresses/imaging_and_applied_optics/computational_optical_sensing_and_imaging/">
            Computational Optical Sensing and Imaging (COSI)</a>, 23-27 June in
          Arlington, Virginia (USA). They do not seem to have a program
          available yet. But I will update this entry as soon as I discover when
          my talk is supposed to be.<br />

          I was invited to present our results on imaging through opaque layers
          at the MESA+ Colloquium. Every month the MESA+ Institute organize a
          colloquium where one speaker from within the MESA+ and one speaker
          from outside are invited to talk about their research. Such occasions
          are a brilliant opportunity to show what you do to people that might
          be geographically close to you, but work on very different topics and
          interact with them. It is also a good moment to see how people from a
          different field react to what you show them.<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">09 November 2012</span><br />
          This week I was at the PoincarÃ© Institute in Paris to participate to
          the <a href="http://mesoimage.grenoble.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article163">MÃ©soImage
            Workshop</a>. Despite the humble name it was an extremely
          interesting (albeit small) conference, with a lot of excellent talks.
          There I presented our work "<a href="papers/Nature2012.pdf">Non-invasive
            imaging through opaque scattering layers</a>" just the day after it
          was published.<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">08 November 2012</span><br />
          <img align="left" src="images/Nature491cover.jpg" alt="Nature Cover" style="width: 180px; height: 237px;" />After
          two years of work the article "Non-invasive imaging through opaque
          scattering layers" is finally out!<br />
          Not only we managed to get it <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7423/full/nature11578.html">published
in
            Nature</a>, but we also got <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7423/index.html">the
            cover</a> and a <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v491/n7423/full/491197a.html">News&amp;Views</a>
          written by <a href="http://lo.epfl.ch/people">Demetri Psaltis and
            Ioannis Papadopoulos</a>. I can really say that all the work done
          paid off really well in the end.<br />
          I am extremely proud of this work for many reason but one of them is
          surely the fact that, in the end, the experimental apparatus is
          extremely simple. There are many cases where a complex and
          technologically advance system is required to perform a measurement.
          But I always found a lot more gratification in those rare occasion
          where you can exploit your idea with just a limited amount of
          components on the table.<br />
          For a quick overview of the results presented in the paper you can

          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">15 August 2012</span><br />
          Today I gave a talk at the <a href="http://spie.org/x30491.xml">SPIE

          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Abstract</span>: As light
          propagates through a disordered material, fields in various incident
          free space modes are mixed by scattering to generate the transport
          channels, linear combinations of incident modes that pass through the
          system. We aim to measure and address individual transport channels in
          disordered structures. For this purpose, we combine wavefront shaping
          methods and interferometric detection. Investigating light transport
          at the single channel level enables in depth study of interference
          effects and can be used to detect absorption or localization in the
          system.<br />

            style="font-style: italic;">"Optical Properties of Photonic
            Structures: Interplay of Order and Disorder"</span> is ready and
          will be soon available. For more information on the release date refer
          to the <a href="http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439871911">publisher
            page</a>. <br />
          This book deals with the complicate problem of how disorder affects
          photonic structures and how we can turn disorder from a nuisance to a
          resource when we fabricate functional optical materials. This is a
          relatively new field and the literature on this subject is very
          scattered.<br />
          This is not a monograph but more a collection of essays where a lot of
          the major contributors to the field (with some surprising exception)
          describe the forefront of the scientific research they have done on
          the subject.<br />
          In this book I co-authored (together with Kevin Vynck, Pierre
          Barthelemy and Diederik S. Wiersma) the chapter <span style="font-style: italic;">"Superdiffusion
            of light in LÃ©vy glasses"</span>.<br />

          <img align="left" src="images/MesaPlus.jpg" alt="MESA + logo" style="width: 200px; height: 88px;" />Today
          I had a talk at the annual <a href="http://www.utwente.nl/mesaplus/events/mesa_meeting/">MESA+
            meeting</a> day. The <a href="http://www.utwente.nl/mesaplus/">MESA+
            institute</a> includes <a href="http://www.utwente.nl/mesaplus/participating_research_groups/">28
            groups</a> that do research on Nanotechnology.<br />
          Nanotechnology is a very broad term and thus you can find groups
          working on Nanophotonics, Biophysics, Fluid physics, Nanoelectronics
          etc. As a result in a meeting that put all of them together you are
          bound to encounter a lot of science that is new to you.<br />
          The downside is, of course, that you will not understand a large part
          of it. But the upside is that you can get exposed to a lot of
          different things making such a meeting a very good occasion to have
          new ideas. Another very big upside is that, being a local meeting, all
          those people work relatively close to me and thus it is easy to start
          collaboration that can actually work out.<br />

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">19 Sep 2011</span><br />
          The tutorials on random walks and on LÃ©vy flights are now linked also
          from the <a href="http://cops.nano-cops.com/?q=node/628">COPS website</a>.
          A new tutorial on Digital Holography is under preparation.<br />
          <br />
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">30 Aug 2011</span><br />
          Added a few links to the link page.<br />
