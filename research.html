          <h2>Current Interests</h2>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Imaging in biological systems:</span>
          Scattering is a huge problem for non-invasive optical imaging in
          biological systems, as scattering from the inhomogeneities in the
          tissue often limit microscopy to the surface of the sample or (at
          best) to a shallow depth. Optical imaging through a strongly
          scattering system is currently an unsolved problem, but in recent
          years several possible approaches were put forward. The line of
          research I follow is based on the idea that multiple scattered light
          possesses non-trivial correlations, which can be exploited to extract
          information from beyond a scattering material.<br /><br />
          <strong>Analogue computation using light:</strong> Nowadays we are
          used to the idea that <em>computation</em> is synonymous with <em>digital
            computers</em>, but it wasn't always like that. Analogue computers
          had a very important role until a few decades ago. Modern
          technological developments, like the introduction of fast and reliable
          spatial light modulators, allow us to control light propagation to a
          degree that was unthinkable just a few years ago, opening the
          possibility to a revival of analogue computation (or at least hybrid
          analogue-digital computation) using light to perform selected tasks at
          the speed of light.<br /><br />

          <strong>Light scattering in correlated systems:</strong> Describing
          transport in a disordered environment is a complicated task, so it is
          no surprise that some simplifying assumptions are made. The most
          common of these assumptions is that the <em>disorder</em> can be
          modeled as white noise, i.e. all the correlations are neglected. But
          if we look around us most of what we see definitively does not show a
          <em>crystalline</em>  kind of order and periodicity, but it is not
          even white noise. Most of the time things have some degree of
          randomness, but still have correlations. Understanding how light (or
          other waves) propagate in a correlated disordered potential is still an understudied problem, which can have very practical
          applications.<br />
          <br />
          <h2>Past interests (that resurface quite often)</h2>
          <strong>Anderson localization:</strong> When light scattering gets so
          strong that successive scattering event can not be treated as
          independent anymore, interference between different possible paths
          become dominant and the system has a phase transition from a <em>conductive</em>
          (diffusive) regime to a <em>localized</em> regime where
          diffusion-like transport is impossible. This regime is known as
          Anderson localization. There is a heated debate if Anderson
          localization of light in 3D is even possible at all, but even Anderson
          localization in 1D and 2D keeps showing surprising results, even after
          many years of study.<br /><br />
          <strong>Anomalous transport:</strong> In the textbook case of normal
          diffusion, particle transport is described as a random walk to which
          all the steps give the same contribution (Brownian motion).
          Superdiffusion occurs when the transport is dominated by a few very
          large steps (Lévy flights). In this regime the variance of the step
          length distribution diverges and the mean square displacement grows
          faster than linear with time, leading to what is known as <em>anomalous
            diffusion</em>.<br />
