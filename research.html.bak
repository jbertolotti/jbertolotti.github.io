        <div class="left"> I am interested in most transport phenomena,
          especially about wave transport and how scattering and disorder effect
          it. Since I am an experimentalist, and every experimentalist needs to
          specialize a bit, I mostly focus my research on light transport in
          disordered media.<br />
          <br />
          <h2>Current Interests</h2>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Imaging in biological systems:</span>
          Scattering is a huge problem for non-invasive optical imaging in
          biological systems, as scattering from the inhomogeneities in the
          tissue often limit microscopy to the surface of the sample or (at
          best) to a shallow depth. Optical imaging through a strongly
          scattering system is currently an unsolved problem, but in recent
          years several possible approaches were put forward. The line of
          research I follow is based on the idea that multiple scattered light
          possesses non-trivial correlations, which can be exploited to extract
          information from beyond a scattering material.<br />
          <strong>Analogue computation using light:</strong> Nowadays we are
          used to the idea that <em>computation</em> is synonymous with <em>digital
            computers</em>, but it wasn't always like that. Analogue computers
          had a very important role until a few decades ago. Modern
          technological developments, like the introduction of fast and reliable
          spatial light modulators, allow us to control light propagation to a
          degree that was unthinkable just a few years ago, opening the
          possibility to a revival of analogue computation (or at least hybrid
          analogue-digital computation) using light to perform selected tasks at
          the speed of light.<br />
          <strong>Light scattering in correlated systems:</strong> describing
          transport in a disordered environment is a complicated task, so it is
          no surprise that some simplifying assumptions are made. The most
          common of these assumptions is that the <em>disorder</em> can be
          modeled as white noise, i.e. all the correlations are neglected. But
          if we look around us most of what we see definitively does not show a
          <em>crystalline</em>  kind of order and periodicity, but it is not
          even white noise.<br />
          <br />
          <h2>Past interests (that resurface quite often)</h2>
          <strong>Anderson localization:</strong> When light scattering gets so
          strong that successive scattering event can not be treated as
          independent anymore, interference between different possible paths
          become dominant and the system has a phase transition from a <em>conductive</em>
          (diffusive) regime to a <em>localized</em> regime where
          diffusion-like transport is impossible. This regime is known as
          Anderson localization. There is a heated debate if Anderson
          localization of light in 3D is even possible at all, but even <br />
          <h2>Anderson Localization<br />
          </h2>
          <img align="left" alt="localized mode" src="images/localized_mode.jpg"
            style="width: 238px; height: 250px;" />Propagation in disordered
          media is characterized by multiple scattering. If the disorder is weak
          the transport can be usually  described  in terms of a diffusion
          process.<br />
          For the transport of waves (in our case light) this  results in a
          system with speckle-like extended eigenmodes. If the amount of
          disorder is increased the system become more and more diffusive but,
          contrary to the case of incoherent transport, this behavior does not
          continue indefinitely. In fact, when the disorder become bigger than a
          certain threshold, there is a phase transition to a transport regime
          where the eigenmodes are exponentially localized and thus no
          diffusion-like transport is possible.<br />
          This regime, named Anderson Localization after P.W. Anderson who fist
          predicted it, is characterized by a very low mobility (only tunneling
          between spatially separated modes is possible) and is the subject of
          intense research since more than 30 years.<br />
          <br />
          <h2>Anomalous transport, Lévy Flights and Superdiffusion<br />
          </h2>
          <img align="left" src="images/brown_plus_levy.png" alt="comparison between a brownian and a levy motion"
            style="width: 238px; height: 200px;" />In the textbook case of
          normal diffusion, particle transport is described as a random walk to
          which all the steps give the same contribution (Brownian motion, black
          curve in the picture on the left). Superdiffusion occurs when the
          transport is dominated by a few very large steps (Lévy flights, red
          curve in the picture on the left). In this regime the variance of the
          step length distribution diverges and the mean square displacement
          grows faster than linear with time.<br />
          Turbulent media or composite structures (such as biological tissues,
          rock strata or clouds formations) can give rise to very long-range
          correlated disorder with large fluctuations. Also complex and
          non-linear media are known to produce wild oscillations. In all these
          cases the probability to perform a very large step becomes
          non-negligible and superdiffusion ensues.<br />
          Superdiffusion is known to play an important role in very diverse
          fields like Ethology, Economy, Geology, Astrophysics, Plasma physics
          etc. but is still poorly understood.<br />
          Light superdiffusion offers one of the few experimental system that
          can be reliably reproduced in the laboratory.<br />
          <h2>Wavefront shaping<br />
          </h2>
          <img vspace="0" hspace="0" align="left" src="images/Vellekoop_Mosk_2008_schematic_en_after.thumbnail.jpg"
            alt="wavefront shaping" style="border: 0px solid ; width: 150px; height: 143px;" />The
response
          of a disordered material to an excitation (e.g. a ray of light) might
          be complex but it is nevertheless deterministic and, if absorption is
          negligible, linear. An important consequence of this fact is that,
          shaping the incident light in both amplitude and phase, it is possible
          to control the output (e.g. the transmitted light).<br />
          This allows for an unprecedented ability to control the propagation of
          light <span style="font-style: italic;">inside</span> a disordered
          medium and thus to characterize the transport properties of even the
          most complex media.<br />
